Be A Star is an offline 2D board game designed for musicians and wannabe musicians. Roll the dice, see when is your turn and accept your destiny. 
You can be the one to finish all the 3 rounds but the winner will be decided by the money the players have received during the match. Surprise blocks, freeze 
blocks and many more are included.
